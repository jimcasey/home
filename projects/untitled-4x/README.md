# Untitled 4x Game Project

## Impetus:

I've spent countless hours on Civilization Revolution on the iPad – the simplicity of the game is very meditative for me – but I've often thought:

- Can this be a more calming game experience?
- Can we reduce into a simpler game?
- Can we make this something that's playable on a phone?

**Goal:** Produce a platform that can drive a 4x (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) strategy game, with the hope of producing a game similar to Civilization Revolution, but that is more soothing (think Metro) and playable on the iPhone as well as the iPad.

**Purpose:** The purpose of this project is to play around with some concepts around 4x gaming as a prerequisite for this goal.

## Research & Resources:

- [Hexagonal Grids](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) _Red Blob Games_
- [Wraparound hexagon tile maps on a sphere](https://www.redblobgames.com/x/1640-hexagon-tiling-of-sphere/) _Red Blob Games_

## To Do:

- [ ] Separate engine and playground projects
  - [ ] Get a bundler and dev server working (Parcel does not seem to want to work with workspaces)
- [ ] Generate hexagonal map with definite edges
- [ ] Unit that can move with specific rules
- [ ] Map obstacles and unit limitations
- [ ] Hexagonal map with wraparound
